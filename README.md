# Mato
Mato is a Material Design inspired icon theme for Linux. It features simple and modern icons based on the official icons. Although this icon theme is based on the Material Design Guidelines, I don't follow them 100%.

## Install
You can install Mato by executing the following command in your terminal.
```bash
cd ~/.icons/; rm -rf Mato/; git clone https://github.com/flipflop97/Mato.git;
```

## Request icons
Until the icon theme has most of the basic icons, please don't request any icons.
