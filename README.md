# Mato
Mato is a Material Design inspired icon theme for Linux. It features simple and modern icons based on the official icons. Although this icon theme is based on the Material Design Guidelines, I don't follow them 100%.

## Install
You can install Mato by cloning the repository and running the install script to copy the icons to the right place
I will post a fully automatic installation method soon!

## Request icons
Until the icon theme has most of the basic icons, please don't request any icons.
