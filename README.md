Mato is a Material Design inspired icon theme for Linux. It features simple and modern icons based on the official icons. Although this icon theme is based on the Material Design Guidelines, I don't follow them 100%.

*Mato is currently in development, many icons are missing or will be changed.*

## Install
Arch Linux users can install Mato using the AUR package `mato-icons-git`.

Otherwise, you can install and update Mato by executing the following command in your terminal.
```bash
sh -c 'cd /tmp; rm -rf Mato/; git clone https://github.com/flipflop97/Mato.git; Mato/install.sh'
```

I'm working on getting packages ready for other distros, they will be available soonâ„¢.
